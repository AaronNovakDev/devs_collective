## Continued Questions

# R7	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

The problem that i am solving is when I go to a website and I see a problem, I always feel like I would like to report the problem, it can just be a simple spelling mistake or even some major sort of information that I would think the company that created the website/app would like to know, and I beleive that information is extremely valuable and a lot of big companies would love that feedback. They spend millions of dollars on programs that show where a user clicks on the screen, and they are to try and decipher why the user has clicked that buttong, and even then thats only a guess at best.
So I want to create a kind of all user "hackathon" they always say sometimes its better to not have an educated eye because you over look the basic problems.

# R8	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

I beleive that there is a lot more improvement on basically any website or app and having an app that companies and end users alike can use and talk to eachother and work out what the problems are and how they can be fixed would be a great step forward. It also enables every one to have a say on what they are thinking, that information is extremely valuable.
